 * English or हिन्दी — because a half-translated Hinglish interface would need
 * every string written twice anyway, and the student picks one by looking at it.
 *
 * The interface only ever changes when the student picks it in Settings → Language and voice, and
 * the choice is kept in this device's storage. It is deliberately *not* derived from the account's
 * `preferred_language`: a student who typed to the guide in Devanagari had the whole interface flip
 * to Hindi on the next load, which nobody asked for and which looks like the app misbehaving.
 * Conversation language stays automatic and server-side; interface language stays manual and local.
